legume: Differentiable guided mode expansion methods
====================================================

**legume** (*le GUided Mode Expansion*) is an open source Python package that implements a differentiable guided mode expansion (GME) method for multi-layer optical structures. Legume also implements a differentiable plane wave expansion (PWE) method for purely two-dimensional periodic structures. Legume uses the `HIPS autograd <https://github.com/HIPS/autograd>`_ package for its automatic differentiation capabilities.
